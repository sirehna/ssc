/**
@defgroup geometry Geometry
\brief This module is a simple wrapper around Boost.geometry and libGeographic.

\details
\subsection Types
The basic underlying types are:
- LongitudeLatitude: position on the globe (in spherical, Cartesian or geographical coordinates)
- Angle: conversion between various angle units

\subsection Algorithms
The implemented algorithms are:
- Leg: determine the length of a Leg or find a point on a Leg
- Track: determine the length of a Track or find a point on a Track
- PointInCartesianPolygon: test if a point lies in a polygon on the earth surface, defined in Cartesian coordinates
- PointInSphericalPolygon: test if a point lies in a polygon on the earth surface, defined in spherical coordinates
- PointInGeographicalPolygon: test if a point lies in a polygon on the earth surface, defined on the WGS84
