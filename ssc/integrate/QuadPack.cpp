If the position of a local difficulty can be determined (e.g. singularity, discontinuity within the interval) one will probably gain from splitting up the interval at this point and calling the integrator on the subranges. If possible, an appropriate special-purpose integrator should be used, which is designed for handling the type of difficulty involved.");
